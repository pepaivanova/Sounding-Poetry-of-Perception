<a name="significance" class="anchor" href="#significance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Significance</h3>

<p>The project is as multilayered as the composed soundscapes it develops. Provoking a synesthetic experience of
an artwork, were visuals became poetry, and poetry a sound score. It not only assigns specific value to the object
we perceive, but questions our abilities of fully experience the surrounding.
