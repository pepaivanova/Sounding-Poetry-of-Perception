Sounding poetry of perception
=============================

## Description

In Sounding Poetry, textual descriptions become a score for sound compositions, where different words correspond to field recordings and sounds. The created soundscape is composed by oneâ€™s interpretation of his/her own visual experience into words.

## Motivation

No particular reason

## Goals

* Create simple web server for interaction with PD.
* Use Pure Data to mix .mp3 files.
* Create simple database with .mp3 files.
* Synchronise database with soundcloud or other web platform. - OSC?
* Use Pure Data to stream soundscapes from web platform and mix them.
* Automatic synchronisation between web platform and local database.?!

## Status - just started

(Just started, Development, Testing, Production)

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* [Pure Data (pd-extended)](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)

## Considerations

We should stick to Python solution with integrated dependencies.

There are many options for communication with Pure Data and we should consider the best way for the project.
Few available options are:

1. Pure Data + Python
2. Pure Data + Node.js
3. Pure Data + Jython
