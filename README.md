Sounding poetry of perception
=============================

## Description

As time goes by the project is getting clearer. Actually the Sounding Poetry is a device, where anyone could describe his visual perception on given art in written form. The device takes the input text as a raw data and generates unique soundscape according the text. At the end small thermal printer prints the message on a paper.

## Hardware

* This project uses old laptop Asus AspireOne + Thermal Printer COM-10438

Initially we have decided to use following hardware:

* Raspberry Pi ([Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org) + [pd-extended](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended-0-43-3-on-raspberry-pi-raspbian-wheezy-armhf))
* 7'' TV/Monitor with A/V input
* bluetooth keyboard & mouse
* usb wifi adapter (realtek)

problems with Raspberry Pi hardware:

* low video quality from RCA output (small monitor with HDMI is expensive)
* there is no really small usb keyboard

You could see how to install the project on Raspberry Pi in [README_Pi.md](web/README_Pi.md)

Another hardware that we have tried is Olinuxino A13 + WiFi.
The system has 10'' screen with touch screen and the quality is really good.
There are problems with the debian libraries for pure data.
Some of the libraries are missing and on pd works, pd-extended should be
compiled from source, but there are missing libraries, which can't be updated
with the image provided from olimex.

Therefore we decided to use really small laptop with x86 architecture to finish
the project. This could be second life for such small notebooks :)

## Motivation

In Sounding Poetry, textual descriptions become a score for sound compositions, where different words correspond to field recordings and sounds. The created soundscape is composed by oneâ€™s interpretation of his/her own visual experience into words.

## Goals

* Create simple web server for interaction with PD.
* Use Pure Data to mix .mp3 files.
* Create simple database with .mp3 files.
* Synchronise database with soundcloud or other web platform. - OSC?
* Use Pure Data to stream soundscapes from web platform and mix them.
* Automatic synchronisation between web platform and local database.?!

## Status - development

(Just started, Development, Testing, Production)

## Dependencies

* Python > 2.7
* [Pure Data (pd-extended)](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
* [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org)
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
* Pure Data netsend for communication
