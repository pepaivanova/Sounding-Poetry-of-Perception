Sounding poetry of perception
=============================

## Description

In Sounding Poetry, textual descriptions become a score for sound compositions, where different words correspond to field recordings and sounds. The created soundscape is composed by oneâ€™s interpretation of his/her own visual experience into words.

## Motivation

## Goals

1. Use Pure Data to mix .mp3 files.
2. Create simple database with .mp3 files.
3. Synchronise database with soundcloud. - OSC?
4. Use Pure Data to stream soundscapes from soundcloud and mix them.
5. Create simple web server for interaction with PD.
6. Automatic synchronisation between soundcloud and local database.?!

## Considerations

There are many options for communication with Pure Data and we should consider the best way for the project.
Few available options are:

1. Pure Data + Python
2. Pure Data + Node.js
3. Pure Data + Jython
