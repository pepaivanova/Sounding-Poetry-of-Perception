    The project explores the relationship between our perception and the individual experience of constructing reality.
    A complicated sensory mechanism navigates our daily experiences where light and sounds draw the surroundings.<br />
    A significant part of our perception is substituted and enhanced by our ability to imagine as well as by using
    other sensory modalities, for example by hearing or making visual analogies. For example we see an object,
    which remind us situation and previous experience or we process information though our knowledge about it,
    or we can imagine how far object sounds, without being able to hear it because of the distance.<br/>
    The synesthetic approach of the project is an invitation for a more precise visual investigation of what surrounds us and
    challenges ability to describe. The name The Poetry of Perception is chosen because poets, to provoke our imagination,
    initially refer to visual objects, forms or conditions in written text. In Sounding Poetry, textual descriptions become
    a score for sound compositions, where different words correspond to field recordings and sounds.<br />
    The created soundscape is composed by oneâ€™s interpretation of his/her own visual experience into words.
